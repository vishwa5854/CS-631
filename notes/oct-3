1. If hard links are found on inode array what about the
    soft links?
2. How are we managing the metadata on the disk as we mani-
    -pulate data only on memory? What happens in the case of
    a sudden power cut?
3. Does this mean it would impact the start time based on the
    number of files we have in our file-system or disk?
4. We are going to use FTS for the "ls" assignment.
5. What is Y2K38 problem, see and refer?
6. What is daylight savings time?

NOTES
1. File names are not stored in inode blocks, rather they are stored
    in directory blocks as a hardlink to actual data blocks.
2. Multiple hardlinks could refer to same inode number.
3. Directories are special files containing a list of hard links.
4. Each directory contains atleast two entries.
    . -> current directory reference
    .. -> parent directory reference
5. The actual name of a directory exists in it's parent directory 
    blocks as a hard link.
6. The inode contains most of the info found in struct stat.
7. Every inode has a link count (st_nlink in struct stat), it shows 
    how many things are pointing to it. If the number of links are 0, 
    and no process has the file open then and only then those data 
    blocks are freed.
8. Moving a file in the same file system is simple, just move the
    directory entry.
9. Who has root dir entries then ?? What about . and .. for root ?
10. We need write permission to rename a file in the parent directory
