sockets allow us for commmunication accross the internet or local with wide variety of protocols
SOCKET_STREAM -- allows for connection oriented, reliable two way sequential communication
SOCKET_DGRAM -- allows for connectionless unreliable messages like UDP
SOCKET_RAW for anything else and u wanna deal with other internal protocols
SOCKET_RAW is accessible only for super user
Sockets are used to communicate among unrelated processes
We get a file descriptor on succesful creation of socket with which we can use read write calls to
send and recieve the data. But we use send and sendto to send the data
