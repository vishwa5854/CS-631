1. Pipe can be used among related process but a named pipe FIFO can be used accross unrelated processes.
2. Shared Memory is the fastest IPC since the memory exists in kernel space and process can read from it
using the shmkey and no copying of data into the new process buffer or something of that sort
3. popen will create an IPC, fork a new process, invoke the shell and execute commands on the shell
4. Message queues store the data in the queue until and unless the message is read by another 
process, once read it will be removed from the queue, and we can assign priorites to push the message 
forward or backward in the queue
5. Tee command takes one input and splits the data into two output streams
