1. Check for return values
2. Don't use strcpy use the safer function.
3. Use only FTS duhhhh
4. Use strmode(3) to get the permissions string which is already there
5. Avoid code duplication, if else branches especially
6. Try to return early if we can (Rather than having multiple nested if
    blocks, simplify it using returns.)
7. Read about char * const * which we use for FTS
