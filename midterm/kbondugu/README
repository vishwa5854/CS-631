This is a simple ls utility tool written in C

Things that don't work as of now
1. -a & -A are broken, I need some time to fix this
2. Return values are not hanled properly, need some time for that
3. For a directory, if you want to display all the descendants
    you should add a '/' at the end of your path, need to fix this as well.
