This is a simple ls utility tool written in C

Problems I have faced
1. Getting the base ls function with fts was confusing, mostly
    because of my poor understanding of the manual page in the 
    starting.
2. Parsing the spaces between different types of data
3. Dealing with time was a little bit tricky, I almost forgot
    that the tm_year we get in the struct tm*  from localtime
    is year - 1900, I wasted like 2 hours debugging that.
4. Header files, common data structures management, eventually
    with the help of provided sample guide by prof. I figured
    out how to share a header properly accross multiple c files.


Things that were crazy
1. Trying to implement ls -R without running into segfaults
    or stack overflow or memory errors, I spent more than 
    2 days until I landed on this two pointer approach
    which took a lot of thinking, It was even in my sleep :(
2. Formatting, its a tedious thing to implement, its not hard
    but very lengthy and made me feel dumb for writing those
    many lines of same logic

Things I have learnt
1. stat - Now I am pretty confident about all the params in it lol
2. fts - file traversing using fts
3. A lot of things in C language like memory management, buffers,
    pointers, segfaults :(, wild errors and crashes.
