YES

Did I make sure that my .h files only include function
forward declarations, macros, etc., no function
implementations or other code?
YES

Did I check that I have avoided code duplication?
Writing the same or very similar code multiple times
is a sign that my program could benefit from being
restructured.
Very minimal duplications not more than few lines,
there were some duplications in ls_recurse function
I tried to avoid it but I have already spent alot of
time on -R
