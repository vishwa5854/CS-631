1. If we pass only one file that don't exist, then it is segfaulting -- done
2. If we pass the files with names it is not ls'sing them
3. The best strategy is to iterate 


-l symlink pointer
pre-process dirs and add '/' for my program to work
for every dir print a dirname and :
Handle return values
-a is not working properly -A


-- done all files first, then dir
isatty -- must done
sudo user direct -a -- done
free everything -- done
there is a blocks num1, num2
humanize number function -- use this
printDir, printFiles separate would be good -- didn't separate but good
for more than one dir ; dir_name : \n data
gotta print total as well for every directory
check for cyclic dir, error dir

print total only when is l or n or to a terminal
look up getopts -- this is some black magic
entryStat or stat ???


future times -- time printing handling that
+- 6 months only it displays the time -> hour : secs but any more than that just 
month and year

for executables check for all perms S_IXUSR, SIXGRP, S_IXOTH -- done

if file name is not there just refer to the path burh in the stat

put exit function somewhere in some other function -- using errno instead

directly use nsec instead for time -- done

-- check ls 5 4 2 3 1 what's the output -- done

symlink to a file that does'nt exist -- done

non printable char -- done

1, 1 for charecter device

default include path is usr/include
just do a grep for constansts in /usr/include

sys/syslimits -> is what u need

-s -- done
0 spacing needs to be handled for n_blocks -- done
total is also pending -- done


-l c dev is not done, 
-R option is pending
-d pending
