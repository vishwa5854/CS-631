This is a simple C program that trivially copies files.

Things that work with this
1. bbcp existing existing2 
2. bbcp existing non-existing 
3. bbcp non-existing anything 
4. bbcp no-inputs 
5. bbcp source no-target 
6. bbcp source multiple-targets
7. bbcp /source-is-a-dir /existing 
8. bbcp existing /existing
9. bbcp existing /non-existing

Problems Faced
1. I could not understand how to handle absolute paths and relative paths together, so I searched
online if there is anything in C that can give me absolute path no matter what and found realpath.
2. I had problems handling other types of files like links but made it to work with softlinks and hardlinks for files but not for directories.
3. I have never used make before, so I read basics of make online.
